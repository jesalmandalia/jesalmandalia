### 👋 Hi there! I'm Jesal ⭐

🌌 Particle Physics PhD researching high-mass W Bosons at CERN's ATLAS detector.

⚡ Fun fact: CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) detectors collide particles 1 billion times/second, churning out a whopping petabyte of data every second! 🤯

🚀 Currently transitioning into the captivating realm of data as an AiCore data trainee! 

🛠️ Excited to unravel insights and engineer solutions!
